I wanted to make a new portfolio site with a very simple design; my last one was done using a wordpress.org template that just had too way much going on. I liked that this design template was a single page, without clicking or complications for employers to navigate. The javascript is minimal with just the floating contact me button coded to be sticky while responding to device sizes and layout that change with flex boxes. I used a template and followed along with a youtube tutorial, but it was quite a bit more complicated since it included things like sccs, emmit, and kirby - which I didn't have any knowledge of, but I think this class has helped me to be able to navigate more complex code. I customized fonts, colors, and eliminated the blog section of the design and moved the portfolio titles. I think it works well as a very simple and quick portfolio that can be used for a variety of jobs - which I will probably apply for, though eventually, I will try to hone in just animation, create more content for my portfolio and make a website like this one solely devoted to an animation reel. Just starting, though, I think this is going to me more helpful for to find a media arts related part-time job.
